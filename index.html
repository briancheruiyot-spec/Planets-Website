      Planets Of Our Solar System
  </h1>
  <h2 class="heading-2">

  <p id="introduction">
      Our solar system consists of eight planets, each with unique charactaristics. <br>
      Closest to the Sun is Mercury, a small, rocky planet. Next is Venus, known for its thick, atmosphere and scorching heat. <br>
      Earth, our home, is the only known planet to support life. Mars is a barren, desolate planet. <br>
      Beyond Mars lies the gas giants. Jupiter, the largest planet. Saturn is famous for its rings. <br>
      Beyond Saturn, lies the ice giants. Uranus rotates on its side. <br> 
      And finally, sorry Pluto, Neptune is the farthest planet in the solar system.
  </p>
    
  <h1>Mercury</h1>
  <p>
    Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the Sun, <br> 
    orbiting it in just 88 days. 
    It has a rocky, cratered surface similar to the Moon and experiences extreme temperatures, ranging from about 430°C during the day to -180°C at night due to its lack of a significant atmosphere. 
    With a thin exosphere made mostly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, Mercury cannot support life. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet—that title belongs to Venus. 
    Mercury's surface shows evidence of past volcanic activity, and its large iron core makes up a significant portion of its mass, contributing to its weak magnetic field.
  </p>
  <h1>Venus</h1>
  <p>
    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching around 475°C due to its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, which creates an extreme greenhouse effect. 
    Its surface is covered with vast volcanic plains, highland regions, and thousands of volcanoes, some possibly still active. 
    Venus has crushing atmospheric pressure, about 92 times that of Earth, and its clouds are made of sulfuric acid, making it highly inhospitable. 
    Unlike most planets, Venus rotates slowly and in the opposite direction of its orbit, meaning a day on Venus is longer than its year. Despite its harsh conditions. 
    Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and rocky composition.
  </p>
  <h1>Earth</h1>
  <p>
    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life, thanks to its liquid water, protective atmosphere, and diverse ecosystems. 
    Its surface is made up of continents and oceans, with a dynamic climate influenced by the atmosphere, which consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. 
    Earth's magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation, while its active geology, including earthquakes and volcanic activity, shapes the land over time. 
    The planet orbits the Sun in about 365 days and rotates once every 24 hours, creating day and night. 
    Earth's biosphere is home to millions of species, making it unique in the solar system.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Mars</h1>
  <p>
    Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, desert-like world with a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide. 
    Its surface is covered in red iron oxide, giving it its nickname, the "Red Planet." 
    Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a massive canyon system, Valles Marineris. 
    Temperatures can drop to around -125°C at night near the poles, making it an inhospitable environment. Despite this, scientists believe Mars once had liquid water and a thicker atmosphere, raising questions about its potential for past or present life. 
    Robotic missions continue to explore Mars, searching for signs of habitability and preparing for future human exploration.
  </p>
  <h1>Jupiter</h1>
  <p>
    Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth from the Sun, known for its massive storms, including the Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. 
    As a gas giant, it has no solid surface, consisting mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a dense core possibly made of rock and metal. 
    Jupiter's immense gravity influences the orbits of many objects in the solar system, and it has at least 95 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. 
    Its powerful magnetic field is the strongest of any planet, trapping radiation and creating intense auroras near its poles.
  </p>
  <h1>Saturn</h1>
  <p>
    Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its spectacular ring system, made of countless ice and rock particles. 
    Like Jupiter, it is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Saturn has a low density, meaning it would float in water if a large enough ocean existed. 
    It has at least 146 moons, including Titan, which is larger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere with lakes of liquid methane. 
    Strong winds and storms occur in its upper atmosphere, and its hexagonal-shaped jet stream at the north pole remains one of its most mysterious features.
  </p>
  <h1>Uranus</h1>
  <p>
    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the coldest in the solar system, with temperatures dropping to around -224°C. 
    It is classified as an ice giant due to its high amounts of water, ammonia, and methane in its atmosphere, which gives it a pale blue color. 
    Unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side, possibly due to a massive collision in the past. 
    This extreme tilt causes its poles to experience 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. 
    It has a faint ring system and at least 27 known moons, many named after characters from Shakespearean plays
  </p>
  <h1>Neptune</h1>
  <p>
    Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a cold and windy ice giant with a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. 
    It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of over 2,000 km/h, creating massive storms and dark spots in its atmosphere. 
    Neptune takes 165 years to complete one orbit around the Sun and has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. 
    It also has faint rings made of dust and ice. Despite its distance, Neptune was discovered mathematically before it was seen through a telescope, based on disturbances in Uranus’s orbit.
